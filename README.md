The repository provides a minimal implementation for the stochastic series
expansion algorithm -- a highly efficient Quantum Monte Carlo algorithm for
the simulation of the Spin-1/2 XXZ model or hard-core boson model in
thermal equilibrium. The detailed description of the algorithm can be found at
https://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0202316. The focus of the implementation is
two-fold: first, I provide an efficient implementation without additional
coding overhead in order to allow beginners to easily modify the Quantum Monte
Carlo simulation for their purposes as fast as possible. Second, the
implementation adds support for diagonal and off-diagonal disorder, i.e., it
extents the algorithm explicitly discussed in the above publication to the case
of non-translational invariant Hamiltonians. Therefore, no symmetries between
possible vertex configurations exists. For all possible vertex configurations
consult Fig. 8 in https://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0202316. To my knowledge this
is the only open source implementation that provides support for the general,
non-translational invariant case. In this general case the directed loop
equations have to be solved for each site in real space separately. Depending on
the random field and random hopping at the site, bounces in the directed loop
construction can be either avoided or the probability can be minimized by
bouncing on the vertex configuration with the highest weight.


General Usage
-------------

To run the Quantum Monte Carlo simulation specify the system parameters in the
python script run_SSE.py and execute the script. The specific disorder
distribution for the disorder average can be modified in the python script
disorder_average.py.
